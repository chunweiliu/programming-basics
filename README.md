# Programming Basics
Problems for practing the following concepts:

### Software Engineering
- Object oriented programming
- Test driven development

### Algorithms
- Depth first search in an unique decision tree
- Recursive descent parsing

### Python
- Recursive data type: E.g. Trie or something similar to `defaultdict(DataClass)`
- Mutable copy data in recursion
- Better naming by using `namedtuple` or `class` if needed
- Better visualizing objects by using `__repr__`
